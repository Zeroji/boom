## BOOM
*Badly Object-Oriented Mess*

### Installation

Start by questionning your own sanity. Then, install
[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) 2.4.2 (or above, if it still works)
somewhere on your system. I'll assume you know how to clone a Git
project, so just make sure [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is installed
and run a good old `cmake .` in the `boom` directory.

### Usage

See previous comment about your sanity. Go wherever the `boom`
executable is located, make sure `res` is there, and run it.
Hopefully it'll support your controller. Or keyboard. No warranty.
